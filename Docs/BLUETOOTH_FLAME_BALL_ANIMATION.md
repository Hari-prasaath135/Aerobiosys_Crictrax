## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### File Modified: `lib/src/views/bluetooth_page.dart`

**Custom Painter Added** (Lines 9-93):
```dart
class FlameBallPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final double rotation;
  final bool isActive;

  FlameBallPainter({required this.rotation, required this.isActive});

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draws red sports ball with glossy shine
    // Draws rotating fire trail (8 flame particles)
    // Orange and yellow flame colors
  }
}
```

**Animation Controller Added** (Lines 136-137):
```dart
late AnimationController _flameController;
late Animation<double> _flameAnimation;
```

**Animation Initialization** (Lines 151-160):
```dart
_flameController = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
  vsync: this,
);
_flameAnimation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 2 * pi).animate(
  CurvedAnimation(parent: _flameController, curve: Curves.linear),
);
```

**Animation Logic**:
- Starts when searching OR connected
- Stops when not searching AND not connected
- Uses linear curve for constant rotation
- 2000ms per full rotation (smooth 360°)

## 🎨 VISUAL DESIGN

### Ball Design
- **Base Color**: Red (#E53935) - sports ball look
- **Size**: 120x120 pixels
- **Shine**: White overlay at 30% opacity
- **Shine Position**: Upper-left (3D effect)

### Fire Trail
- **Count**: 8 flame particles in orbit
- **Colors**: Orange (outer) and Yellow (inner)
- **Animation**: Rotating around ball
- **Effect**: Creates energy and motion
- **Intensity**: Particles fade slightly as they rotate

### Animation
- **Duration**: 2000ms per rotation
- **Curve**: Linear (constant speed)
- **Trigger**: Active during search/connection
- **Performance**: 60fps smooth animation

## 🎯 ANIMATION BEHAVIOR

### States and Animation Control

```
NOT CONNECTED + NOT SEARCHING
    ↓
Icon: Static Bluetooth disabled icon (grey)
Animation: OFF

SEARCHING (No device found yet)
    ↓
Icon: Flame ball with rotating fire
Animation: ON (repeating)
Effect: Energetic searching state

CONNECTED
    ↓
Icon: Flame ball with rotating fire
Animation: ON (repeating)
Effect: Active connection with energy

EXISTING CONNECTION (Page load)
    ↓
Icon: Flame ball with rotating fire
Animation: ON (if already connected)
Effect: Immediately shows active state
```

### Timing Flow

```
1. User taps "Start Scanning"
   → setState() sets isSearching = true
   → _flameController.repeat() starts
   → Flame ball appears and rotates

2. Devices found → User taps device
   → Connection established
   → _flameController.repeat() continues
   → Flame ball keeps rotating

3. Connection active or searching completes
   → User taps "Disconnect" OR scan ends
   → _flameController.stop() / reset()
   → Flame ball replaced with static grey icon
```

## 💻 CODE CHANGES BREAKDOWN

### New Additions

1. **Import Statement**
   ```dart
   import 'dart:math';
   ```
   - Required for `cos()` and `sin()` calculations

2. **FlameBallPainter Class** (~85 lines)
   - Custom painter for flame ball
   - Draws sports ball with shine
   - Draws rotating fire trail
   - Calculates particle positions using trigonometry

3. **Animation Controller** (2 lines)
   - `_flameController`: Controls rotation
   - `_flameAnimation`: Calculates rotation angle (0 → 2π)

4. **Animation Lifecycle** (~20 lines)
   - Initialize in `initState()`
   - Dispose in `dispose()`
   - Start/stop on search
   - Start/stop on connect/disconnect

5. **Main Icon Replacement** (~10 lines)
   - Replace Bluetooth icon with AnimatedBuilder
   - Use CustomPaint to render flame ball
   - Show static icon when not active

### Modified Methods

| Method | Changes |
|--------|---------|
| `initState()` | Added flame controller init |
| `dispose()` | Added flame controller cleanup |
| `startSearching()` | Added _flameController.repeat() |
| `_connectToDevice()` | Added animation start on connect |
| `_disconnectDevice()` | Added animation stop on disconnect |
| `_checkExistingConnection()` | Added animation start if already connected |
| `build()` | Replaced Bluetooth icon with flame ball |

**Total Lines**: ~150 added/modified

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] **Install APK**: `adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- [ ] **Visual Test**:
  1. Open Bluetooth page
  2. Verify: Static grey icon shows (not searching)
  3. Tap "Start Scanning"
