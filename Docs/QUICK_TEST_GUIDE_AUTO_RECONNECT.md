## 🔍 LOGCAT WATCH POINTS

Look for these exact messages (copy-paste to find):

```
"🧹 Clearing LED display"
↓
"✅ LED display cleared"
↓
"🔄 LED clear complete, initiating auto-reconnect..."
↓
"🔄 BleManagerService: Attempting auto-reconnect..."
↓
"✅ Auto-reconnect successful" ← SUCCESS!
```

## ⚡ If Something Goes Wrong

### No Reconnect Message?
- Check if Bluetooth was actually connected before
- Check LED clearing actually happened
- Look for errors in logcat starting with "❌"

### Reconnect Failed?
- Device might be unreachable
- Try manual reconnect (should still work)
- Check device is ON and in range

### Stuck on Victory Dialog?
- This is separate from reconnect
- Close app and restart
- Try again

## 📊 Success Criteria

✅ **Good**: Reconnect succeeds + Bluetooth shows Connected
✅ **Excellent**: Can do 3+ matches without manual reconnect
