# 🎬 Over Animation - Conditional Display Logic

**Date**: February 10, 2025
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED
**Quality**: Production Ready

---

## 📋 Feature Description

The end-of-over animation now displays **conditionally** based on whether significant cricket events occurred during the over:

✅ **Show Animation If**:
- Batsman hit a **boundary (4 runs)**, OR
- Batsman hit a **boundary (6 runs)**, OR
- A **wicket** occurred during the over

❌ **Skip Animation If**:
- Only normal runs scored (1, 2, 3 runs)
- Maiden over (0 runs, no wickets)
- Only extras with no boundaries or wickets

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### State Variables Added

**File**: `lib/src/Pages/Teams/cricket_scorer_screen.dart`
**Lines**: 60-61

```dart
// Track boundaries and wickets in current over
bool _hadBoundaryInOver = false;
bool _hadWicketInOver = false;
```

These boolean flags track whether noteworthy events occurred during the over.

---

### Boundary Tracking

**File**: `lib/src/Pages/Teams/cricket_scorer_screen.dart`
**Lines**: 523-530 (in `addRuns()` method)

```dart
// Trigger boundary animations and track for over animation
if (runs == 4) {
  _triggerBoundaryAnimation('4');
  _hadBoundaryInOver = true;  // ✅ NEW: Track boundary
} else if (runs == 6) {
  _triggerBoundaryAnimation('6');
  _hadBoundaryInOver = true;  // ✅ NEW: Track boundary
}
```

When a 4 or 6 is scored, the `_hadBoundaryInOver` flag is set to `true`.

---

### Wicket Tracking

**File**: `lib/src/Pages/Teams/cricket_scorer_screen.dart`
**Lines**: 598-600 (in `addWicket()` method)

```dart
// Trigger wicket animation and track for over animation
_triggerWicketAnimation();
_hadWicketInOver = true;  // ✅ NEW: Track wicket
```

When a wicket occurs, the `_hadWicketInOver` flag is set to `true`.

---

### Over Completion Logic

**File**: `lib/src/Pages/Teams/cricket_scorer_screen.dart`
**Lines**: 549-564 (in `addRuns()` method - over completion)

```dart
// Show over animation before bowler selection (3 seconds)
// Only show if there were boundaries or wickets in this over
if (_hadBoundaryInOver || _hadWicketInOver) {
  _displayOverAnimation();  // ✅ Show animation
} else {
  // No animation, show bowler dialog directly
  _showChangeBowlerDialog();  // ✅ Skip animation
}

// Reset over tracking flags
_hadBoundaryInOver = false;
_hadWicketInOver = false;
```

**Logic**:
1. Check if `_hadBoundaryInOver` OR `_hadWicketInOver` is true
2. If YES → Display the green rings animation for 3 seconds, then show bowler dialog
3. If NO → Skip animation and show bowler dialog immediately
4. Reset both flags at the end of the over for the next over

---

### Flag Reset

**File**: `lib/src/Pages/Teams/cricket_scorer_screen.dart`
**Lines**: 1967-1972 (in `_resetCurrentOver()` method)

```dart
void _resetCurrentOver() {
  if (currentScore == null) return;
  currentScore!.currentOver = [];
  // Reset over tracking flags
  _hadBoundaryInOver = false;
  _hadWicketInOver = false;
}
```

Both flags are reset whenever the over is reset, ensuring a clean slate for the next over.

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Boundary in Over

```
Over 1, Ball 1: 4 runs scored
    ↓
_hadBoundaryInOver = true
    ↓
Over completes (Ball 6)
    ↓
Check: _hadBoundaryInOver = true
    ↓
✅ SHOW: Green rings animation (3 seconds)
    ↓
After animation: Bowler selection dialog
    ↓
Reset flags for next over
```

**Result**: Green animation displays → Bowler selection dialog

---

### Scenario 2: Wicket in Over

```
Over 1, Ball 3: Wicket
    ↓
_hadWicketInOver = true
    ↓
Over completes (Ball 6)
    ↓
Check: _hadWicketInOver = true
    ↓
✅ SHOW: Green rings animation (3 seconds)
    ↓
After animation: Bowler selection dialog
    ↓
Reset flags for next over
```

**Result**: Green animation displays → Bowler selection dialog

---

### Scenario 3: Only Normal Runs

```
Over 1:
  Ball 1: 1 run
  Ball 2: 2 runs
  Ball 3: 1 run
  Ball 4: 3 runs
  Ball 5: 1 run
  Ball 6: 1 run
    ↓
Total: 9 runs (no boundaries, no wickets)
    ↓
_hadBoundaryInOver = false
_hadWicketInOver = false
    ↓
Over completes
    ↓
Check: _hadBoundaryInOver = false AND _hadWicketInOver = false
    ↓
❌ SKIP: No animation
    ↓
Show bowler selection dialog immediately
    ↓
Reset flags for next over
```

**Result**: No animation → Bowler selection dialog appears immediately

---

### Scenario 4: Maiden Over

```
Over 1:
  Ball 1: Dot (0 runs)
  Ball 2: Dot (0 runs)
  Ball 3: Dot (0 runs)
  Ball 4: Dot (0 runs)
  Ball 5: Dot (0 runs)
  Ball 6: Dot (0 runs)
    ↓
Total: 0 runs (maiden)
    ↓
_hadBoundaryInOver = false
_hadWicketInOver = false
    ↓
Over completes
    ↓
Maiden over SnackBar shown
    ↓
Check: _hadBoundaryInOver = false AND _hadWicketInOver = false
    ↓
❌ SKIP: No animation
    ↓
Show bowler selection dialog immediately
    ↓
Reset flags for next over
```

**Result**: Maiden SnackBar → No animation → Bowler selection dialog

---

### Scenario 5: Wicket + Boundary

```
Over 1:
  Ball 1: 4 runs (boundary)
    ↓
  _hadBoundaryInOver = true
    ↓
  Ball 3: Wicket
    ↓
  _hadWicketInOver = true
    ↓
Over completes
    ↓
Check: _hadBoundaryInOver = true OR _hadWicketInOver = true
    ↓
✅ SHOW: Green rings animation (3 seconds)
    ↓
After animation: Bowler selection dialog
    ↓
Reset flags for next over
```

**Result**: Green animation displays (both conditions met) → Bowler selection dialog
