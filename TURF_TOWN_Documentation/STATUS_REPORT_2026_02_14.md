## 📝 ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issue 1: Cricket Scorer Screen Overlaying After Match ✅
- **Reported**: User couldn't see victory dialog
- **Root Cause**: Navigation didn't pop current screen first
- **Solution**: Added `Navigator.pop()` before `pushAndRemoveUntil()`
- **Files**: `cricket_scorer_screen.dart` (2 locations)
- **Status**: Fixed and tested

### Issue 2: Bluetooth Disconnecting After Match ✅
- **Reported**: Bluetooth disconnected immediately after match
- **Root Cause**: Lifecycle state changes during navigation triggered disconnect
- **Solution**: Only disconnect on `AppLifecycleState.detached`, not on navigation
- **Files**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Status**: Fixed with improved lifecycle handling

### Issue 3: LED Display Overlaying Text ✅
- **Reported**: LED shows overlapping/cascading text during initialization
- **Root Cause**: Command batches sent faster than LED can render (150/200ms vs 250ms needed)
- **Solution**: Increased all delays to 250ms for command batches
- **Files**: `cricket_scorer_screen.dart` (2 methods)
- **Status**: Fixed and documented
