## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Test 4 Fails (Loading Hangs)
1. Check compilation: `flutter analyze`
2. Verify JSON import: Look for `import 'dart:convert'`
3. Check _resumeMatch() method has jsonDecode()
4. Rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run`

### If Test 5 Fails (Data Not Restored)
1. Check pausedState is being saved (in logs)
2. Verify JSON contains all required fields
3. Check JSON parsing in _resumeMatch()
4. Print debug: `print(stateMap)` to see parsed data

### If Test 6 Fails (Buttons Don't Work)
1. Check isInitializing is set to false
2. Verify _initializeMatch() completed
3. Check for error dialogs
4. Run Test 4 again to verify match loaded

### If Test 9 Fails (Multiple Issues)
1. Run each test individually first
2. Note which specific test fails
3. Reference troubleshooting above
4. Document issue with screenshot
