## KEY FIXES DOCUMENTED

### 1. BLE Disconnection Fix ✅
**Issue**: Connection dropped immediately after establishing
**Root Cause**: Dual listeners on device.connectionState stream
**Solution**: Removed duplicate listener from bluetooth_service.dart
**Impact**: Stable BLE connection during entire match
**Commit**: f97cd96

### 2. LED Display Garbage Data Fix ✅
**Issue**: Old data remained on panel after score update
**Root Cause**: No display clear command before sending new data
**Solution**: Added 'FILL 0 0 127 127 0 0 0' command as first LED update
**Impact**: Clean, fresh data always displays on panel
**Commit**: f97cd96
